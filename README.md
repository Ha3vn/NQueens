# NQueens

Created an improved solver for the N-Queens problem using Python. The solver uses an optimized recursive backtracking algorithm to reduce the runtime for a given N to be ~ 30x faster than the original model. This solver was benchmarked on PyPy against Google OR-Toolsâ€™ N-Queens solver and obtained comparable results.
